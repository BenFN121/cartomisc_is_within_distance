Transform raster as data.frame to be later used with ggplot
Modified from rasterVis::gplot
}
\details{
rasterVis::gplot is nice to plot a raster in a ggplot but
if you want to plot different rasters on the same plot, you are stuck.
If you want to add other information or transform your raster as a
category raster, you can not do it. With `cartomisc::gplot_data`, you retrieve your
raster as a data.frame that can be modified as wanted using `dplyr` and
then plot in `ggplot` using `geom_tile`.
If Raster has levels, they will be joined to the final tibble.
